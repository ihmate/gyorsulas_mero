// The check method takes a canStatus (which is an enumerable) and the method
// name as a string argument. If the status is an error code, it will print it.
// Most Canlib method return a status, and checking it with a method like this
// is a useful practice to avoid code duplication.

    if (stat != canOK) {
        char buf[50];

    int channel_number = 0;
    // The msg will be the body of the message we send on the CAN bus.
    char msg[8] = { 0, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 145, 16 };
    // The first thing we need to do is to initialize the Canlib library. This
    // always needs to be done before doing anything with the library.
    canInitializeLibrary();
    printf("Opening channel %d\n", channel_number);
    // Next, we open up the channel and receive a handle to it. Depending on what
    // devices you have connected to your computer, you might want to change the
    // channel number. The canOPEN_ACCEPT_VIRTUAL flag means that it is ok to
    // open the selected channel, even if it is on a virtual device.
    hnd = canOpenChannel(channel_number, canOPEN_ACCEPT_VIRTUAL);
    // If the call to canOpenChannel is successful, it will return an integer
    // which is greater than or equal to zero. However, is something goes wrong,
    // it will return an error status which is a negative number.
    if (hnd < 0) {
        // To check for errors and print any possible error message, we can use the
        // Check method.

    printf("Setting bitrate and going bus on\n");
    // Once we have successfully opened a channel, we need to set its bitrate. We
    // do this using canSetBusParams. CANlib provides a set of predefined bus parameter
    // settings in the form of canBITRATE_XXX constants. For other desired bus speeds
    // bus paramters have to be set manually.
    // See CANlib documentation for more information on parameter settings.
    stat = canSetBusParams(hnd, canBITRATE_250K, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
    Check("canSetBusParams", stat);
    // Next, take the channel on bus using the canBusOn method. This needs to be
    // done before we can send a message.
    stat = canBusOn(hnd);
    Check("canBusOn", stat);
    printf("Writing a message to the channel and waiting for it to be sent \n");
    // We send the message using canWrite. This method takes five parameters:
    // the channel handle, the message identifier, the message body, the message
    // length (in bytes) and optional flags.
    string a = "a";
    do {
        printf("0, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 145, %i \n", msg[7]);
        stat = canWrite(hnd, 178, msg, 8, 0);
        //msg[7] += 10;
        Check("canWrite", stat);
        // After sending, we wait for at most 100 ms for the message to be sent, using
        // canWriteSync.
        stat = canWriteSync(hnd, 100);
        Check("canWriteSync", stat);
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));
    } while (true);
    printf("Going off bus and closing channel");
    // Once we are done using the channel, we go off bus using the
    // canBusOff method. It take the handle as the only argument.
    stat = canBusOff(hnd);
    Check("canBusOff", stat);
    // We also close the channel using the canCloseChannel method, which take the
    // handle as the only argument.
    stat = canClose(hnd);
    Check("canClose", stat);

/*
 Exercises:
  - The canWriteWait method combines canWrite with canWriteSync. Try it out.
  - Use some other program (such as Kvaser CanKing) to listen for messages on
    a different channel on the same device as the one used in your
    program. Make sure to use the same bitrate.
  - Change the fourth parameter in the call to canWrite to 4. What happens to
    the message on the receiving side?
  - Change the message identifier to something large, like 10000. What happens
     on the receiving side? Then, change the fifth parameter to
     canMSG_EXT. What happens now?
